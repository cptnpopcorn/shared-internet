= Switch Setup
:imagesdir: img

This document step by step describes how the current network setup was done on the L3 Layer Switches.
Use a logical_layout.adoc and a physical_layout.adoc documents to understand and reference some setup objects.

== Stacking setup

On the xref:./Layout/logical_layout.adoc#stacking[Stacking chapter of the logical Layout] you will find a table with the L3 Switch location, Stacking ID and priority information.
On the xref:./Layout/physical_layout.adoc[Physcial Layout] you will find which port(s) is used to interconnect L3 Switches for stacking.
Reference to the reference guidefootnote:refguide[DGS-3130 Series Layer 3 Stackable Managed Switch Web UI Reference Guide] to understand what roles play Master, Backup Master and Slaves.

To be able to administer all L3 Switches, you need to use the MGMT (Management) port on the Master Switch. Use `192.168.0.1` on the Internet Browser to reach L3 Switch GUI Web page.

Before interconnecting L3 Switches physically and enabling Stacking on all of them, it is better to connect to each L3 Switch (later as Switch) via the MGMT port and pre-setup the stacking ID and priority in advance using the reference guidefootnote:refguide[]. That will help to avoid any auto ID and Master assignments.

=== Setup Stack ID, Priority and enable stacking

* Connect to every Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu Management > Stacking > Physical Stacking

image::Physical_Stacking_window.png[opts=inline]

* On the *Stack ID* chapter on the Current Unit ID drop down box check that you selected a current unit ID (default for new device is 1) and on the New Box ID select a required Unit ID using the reference guidefootnote:refguide[]. Tick Apply.
* On the *Priority* chapter on the Current Unit ID drop down box check that you selected the current unit ID and on the New Priority select a required Priority using footnote[1]. Tick Apply.
Note: the highest priority has a higher priority number. E.g. Master has 12, others < 12.
* On the *Physical Stacking* chapter set Stacking Mode = Enabled. Tick Apply.

=== Set up the Stacking Bandwidth

* Go to menu *Management > Stacking > Stacking Bandwidth*.
* Select *2-port-SFP+*. Tick Apply.

=== Reboot Switch(es)

* Go to Tools > Reboot System menu on top.
* Choose "Do you want to save settings" = Yes.
* Tick Reboot.

=== Check the Stacking setup

* Connect to Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu *Management > Stacking > Physical Stacking*.
* Check the table.
<insert a real screenshot>
* Check if Master Switch led shows a blinking 1 and H. 'H' means this is a Primary Master.
'h' means an Backup Master. Slaves do not blink and show only stacking number.

== Setup VLANs

Our goal is to separate the private apartments subnetworks and other technical subnetworks.
Refer to the xref:./Layout/logical_layout.adoc#vlan_ids[VLAN IDs chapter of the logical layout].

* Go to menu *L2 Features > VLAN > 802.1Q VLAN*.
* On the 802.1Q VLAN chapter enter VLAN VID *1000* and tick Apply.
VID 1000 is used as Primary VLAN for Shared Internet on the Switch port to ISP modem side.
* On the 802.1Q VLAN chapter enter VLAN VID *1100* and tick Apply.
VID 1100 is used as Isolated VLAN for Shared Internet for all host ports (apartments) side as Private VLAN later.
* Go to the VLANs table, take e.g. VID 1000, tick on Edit and update the name of that VLAN (VID).

== Setup Ports

_TBD: Hosts + Trunk for Tech Codha_

=== Host Ports

We need to change the VLAN type of the physical ports before configuring a VLAN Interface.

* Connect to Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface*.
* Choose Unit 1 on drop-down box.
* On the Unit 1 Settings table choose port 1 (eth1/0/1) and tick Edit.
* Choose *VLAN Mode* = *Host*. Leave an Acceptable Frame = Admit All. Leave Ingress Checking = Enabled.
* Enable the Clone box. And choose From Port: eth1/0/1 and To Port: eth1/0/23. That will help to apply the same Host setup on other ports automatically.
* Tick apply.
* Do the same for other Switches, selecting the specific Unit at the previous page on menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface*. Do the same steps as above.

=== Trunk Ports

Do the same exercise to set up a trunk port for switches outside the stack.

* Connect to the Master Switch via the MGMT port.
* Go to menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface*.
* Choose Unit 1 on drop-down box.
* On the Unit 1 Settings table choose port 24 (eth1/0/24) (this is dedicated for Tech Codha setup) and tick Edit.
* Choose a *VLAN Mode* = *Trunk*. Leave *Acceptable Frame* = *Admit All*. Leave *Ingress Checking* = *Enabled*.
* Tick apply.
* Do the same for other Switches, selecting the specific Unit at the previous page on menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface.*

image::Configure_VLAN_Interface_Trunk_window.png[opts=inline]

=== ISP modem port

Do the same exercise to set up a Host port for the ISP modem side/port connection.

* Connect to Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface*.
* Choose a Unit 1 on drop-down box.
* On the Unit 1 Settings table choose port 26 (eth1/0/26) and tick Edit.
* Choose a *VLAN Mode* = *Promiscuous*. Leave *Acceptable Frame* = *Admit All.* Leave Ingress Checking = Enabled.
* Tick apply.

== Setup a Private VLAN

Now we need to setup a Private VLAN (PVLAN).

* Connect to Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu *L2 Features > VLAN > Private VLAN*.
* On the Private VLAN chapter select *VID List* = *1000*, *State* = *Enabled*, *Type* = *Primary.* Tick Apply.
* On the Private VLAN chapter select *VID List* = *1100*, *State* = *Enabled*, *Type = Isolated*. Tick Apply.
* On the Private VLAN Association chapter select *VID* = *1000* (this is the uplink to the modem VLAN), *Action* = *Add*, Secondary VID List = 1100 (this is a flats VLAN). Tick Apply.
* On the Private VLAN Host Association chapter use From Port: eth1/0/1, To Port: eth1/0/23, *Primary VID* = *1000*, *Secondary VID* = *1100*. Tick Apply.
* On the Private VLAN Mapping chapter use From Port: eth1/0/26, To Port: eth1/0/26, *Primary VID *= *1000*, *Action* = *Add*, *Secondary VID List* = *1100*. Tick Apply.

== Secure VLANs

Remove Shared VLANs from the Trunk (tech Codha) port.
To split the Shared Internet and a Tech Codha subnetworks we need to restrict mutual VLAN visibility.

* Connect to the Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to the menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface*.
* Choose Unit 1 on drop-down box.
* On the Unit 1 Settings table choose port 24 (eth1/0/24) (this is dedicated for Tech Codha setup) and tick Edit.
* As it was setup above, leave a *VLAN Mode* = *Trunk*. Leave *Acceptable Frame* = *Admit All*. Leave *Ingress Checking* = *Enabled*.
* Choose the VLAN (VID) which we need to remove. In our case choose *VID* = *1000*, *Action* = *Remove*
* Tick apply.
* Do the same for *VID* = *1100*.
* Do the same for other Switches, selecting the specific unit at the previous page on menu *L2 Features > VLAN > VLAN Interface*.

== Setup DHCP Snooping

Snooping will sniff DHCP communication to track which MAC gets what IP on what port.

* Connect to the Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu *Security > IMPB > IPv4 > DHCPv4 Snooping > DHCP Snooping Global Settings*
* Set *DHCP Snooping* = *Enabled*. Tick Apply.
* Go to menu *Security > IMPB > IPv4 > DHCPv4 Snooping > DHCP Snooping VLAN Settings*
* Set *VID List* = *1000* and *State* = *Enabled*. Tick Apply.
* Go to menu *Security > IMPB > IPv4 > DHCPv4 Snooping > DHCP Snooping Port Settings*
* Set *From Port* = *eth1/0/26*
* Set *To Port* = *eth1/0/26*
* Set *Trusted* = *Yes*. Tick Apply.
* Go to menu *Security > IMPB > IPv4 > IP Source Guard > IPv4 Source Guard Port Settings*
* Set *From Port* = *eth1/01*, *To Port* = *eth1/0/23*, *State* = *Enabled*, *Validation* = *IP-MAC*. Tick Apply.
* Repeat the previous step for the other units
** *eth2/0/1* - *eth2/0/24*
** *eth4/0/1* - *eth4/0/23*
** *eth7/0/1* - *eth7/0/23*

== Protect router from direct IP connections (configuration interface, UPNP..)

* Connect to Master Switch via Console port (serial cable)
* Enter the follow series of commands, substitute w.x.y.z by internal router IP
* _TBD: need to allow DHCP and DNS, though_
----
enable 15
configure terminal
ip access-list nomodem
deny any host w.x.y.z
exit
interface ethernet 1/0/26
ip access-group nomodem out
