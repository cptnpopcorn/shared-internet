= Switch Setup

This document step by step describes how a current network setup was done on the L3 Layer Switches.
Use a logical_layout.adoc and a physical_layout.adoc documents to understand and reference some setup objects.

== Stacking setup

On the logical_layout.adoc file / Stacking chapter you will find a table with a L3 Switch location, Stacking ID and Priority information.
On the physical_layout.adoc you will find which port(s) is used to interconnect L3 Switches for stacking.
Reference to footnote:[reference to DGS-3130 Series Layer 3 Stackable Managed Switch Web UI Reference Guide] to understand what roles play Master, Backup Master and Slaves.

To be able to administer all L3 Switches, you need to use a MGMT (Management) port on the Master Switch. Use 192.168.0.1 on the Internet Browser to reach L3 Switch GUI Web page.

Before interconnecting L3 Switches physically and enabling Stacking on all of them, it is better to connect to each L3 Switch (later as Switch) via MGMT port and pre-setup Stacking ID and Priority in advance using footnote[1]. That will help to avoid any auto ID and Master assignements.

*Step 1. Setup Stack ID, Priority and enable stacking.*

* Connect to every Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu Management > Stacking > Physical Stacking
* On the *Stack ID* chapter on the Current Unit ID drop down box check that you selected a current unit ID (default for new device is 1) and on the New Box ID select a required Unit ID using footnote[1]. And tick Apply.

* On the *Priority* chapter on the Current Unit ID drop down box check that you selected a current unit ID and on the New Priority select a required Priority using footnote[1]. And tick Apply.
Note: a highest priority has a higher priority number. E.g. Master has 12, others < 12.
* On the *Physical Stacking* chapter make a Stacking Mode = Enabled. And tick Apply.



*Step 2. Setup a Stacking Bandwidth.*

* Go to menu Management > Stacking > Stacking Bandwidth
* Select 2-port-SFP+ . And tick Apply.



*Step 3. Reboot Switch(es).*

* Go to Tools > Reboot System menu on top.
* Choose "Do you want to save settings" = Yes.
* Tick Reboot.

*Step 4. Check a Stacking setup.*

* Connect to Master Switch via MGMT port.
* Go to menu Management > Stacking > Physical Stacking.
* Check the table.
