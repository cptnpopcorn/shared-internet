= Points to clarify / explore / address

Collecting topics that need consideration, identification of available options, choosing the appropriate ones, and testing. Once verified, the final choice will be integrated into the running configuration manual.

== Network layout

=== Possible configurations

==== lots of small routed subnets (verified to work)
* for IPv4 only
* for IPv6 => NAT66 - not supported by switch out-of-the box, difficult with dynamic IPv6 network prefix

==== private VLAN (verified to work)
* for IPv4, IPv6
* to protect from IP conflicts / hi-jacking, activate DHCP snooping

==== Stacking

== Configuration management

=== Switch configuration

==== Building Installation switches (DGS-1216)

==== Ubiquity Edge Router X

==== Shared Internet switches (DGS-3130 series)
* save / load configuration file (= CLI script)

== Security

=== Configuration access

==== Modem
* only via port not connected to building (think about remote troubleshooting later)
* protected by master password

==== Shared Internet switches (DGS-3130 series)
* protected by master password
* configuration only via management port (to start with)
* disable in-band web UI

==== Building Installation switches (DGS-1216)

==== Ubiquity Edge Router X

=== Restricted Modem access
For access port on modem (connected to building network), forbid any access to modem but

* DHCP
* IGMP
* UPNP - exceptions (specific MACs)

==== IPMB (IP-MAC-port binding)

==== ACLs

=== Modem configuration access

== DHCP

== DNS

== Application-specific adjustments

=== Streaming / multi-cast

===== IGMP

=== UPNP port forwarding
* for messengers, file sharing, gaming (hosting a server, live chat..)

==== Known use cases
* Nintendo Switch (reported by Supernet staff)

=== static port forwarding
* individual VPN server
* collaboration server like NextCloud
