=== Case#1 --Static IP address per user
Switch config files on this file attached:
running-config test1 static ip case.cfg

=== Case#2

=== Case#3 --DHCP Server on the L3 Switch



=== Case#4 - DHCP on the Router and Private VLAN on the Switch.
Plus we tried DHCP Snooping option.

That test scenario worked perfectly.
