== How to setup a basic networking

=== Case#1

=== Case#2

=== Case#3
DHCP Server on the L3 Switch



=== Case#4 - DHCP on the Router and Private VLAN on the Switch.
Plus we tried DHCP Snooping option.

That test scenario worked perfectly.

Switch config files on:
running-config DHCP on the Router and Private VLAN and DHCP Snooping.cfg
running-config DHCP on the Router and Private VLAN.cfg
